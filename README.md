Learn Palestinian Arabic</b> is an educational project focusing on the documentation of the Palestinian dialects of
Spoken Arabic. The <b>Learn Palestinian Arabic</b> website includes several features of both educational & linguistic
value:

- [A learning curriculum organized into several Levels](https://abdulbaha.xyz/lessons).
- [Annotated Transcripts of real language content](https://abdulbaha.xyz/texts).
- [A documentation section discussing the dialects on a technical level](https://abdulbaha.xyz/docs).
- [A highly detailed dictionary integrated with the entire site](https://abdulbaha.xyz/dictionary).

<b>Learn Palestinian Arabic</b> is an ambitious project; nothing with its scope exists for any variety of Levantine
Arabic â€” possibly for any variety of Arabic. Once the project reaches more advanced stages, others are encouraged to
create clones of the site for other languages & language varieties.

## Environment Variables

access remote files in the s3 bucket.

`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`

`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`

`AWS_BUCKET`

`AWS_ENDPOINT`

`AWS_USE_PATH_STYLE_ENDPOINT`

## Run Locally

```bash
  git clone git@bitbucket.org:andrewfreddin/learnarabic.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd learnarabic
```

Compose Up docker container

```bash
  docker compose up -d
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  composer install
```

```bash
  npm install
```

Migrate database fresh

  php artisan migrate:fresh
```

Source in database backup to sql docker container

```bash
  mysql -h mysql -P 3306 -u root -p
```

```sql
  mysql> use learnarabic;
```

```sql
  mysql> source arabic23may2023.sql;
```

```sql
  exit
```

Seed file table and upload any new audio files in /public/audio to s3 bucket

```bash
  php artisan audio:upload
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run dev
```

## Documentation

Below is a detailed explanation of custom defined php artisan commands

### file:upload

```bash
  php artisan file:upload
```

`file:upload` will go through the audio directory and upload any files missing in the s3 bucket

### file:link

```bash
  php artisan file:link
```

`file:link` will go through sentences, inflections, and pronunciations, and create a database entry on the file table
for each one of them

### file:migrate

```bash
  php artisan file:migrate
```

`file:migrate` will call both `file:upload` and `file:link`

### file:upload --force and file:migrate --force

```bash
  php artisan file:upload --force
```

```bash
  php artisan file:migrate --force
```

`file:upload --force` and `file:migrate --force` will upload files to the s3 bucket in forced mode, doing so will not 
check if a file already exists in the bucket, instead it will upload the file no matter what, if a file being uploaded
already exists, then it will overwrite the existing file in the s3 bucket
