    <h1>What is AJP?</h1>
    <p><b>AJP</b> is the official <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization"
            target="_blank">ISO</a> abbreviation for <b>South <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levantine_Arabic" target="_blank">Levantine
                Arabic</a></b>. South Levantine Arabic is the name given by <b>Ethnologue</b> — a
        language classification organization — to the <b>Spoken Arabic</b> dialects of Palestine &
        Jordan. Since Wiktionary follows the ISO standard, the name given to this continuum of
        dialects
        on Wiktionary is South Levantine Arabic (AJP). AJP seems to stand for "the <b>A</b>rabic of
        <b>J</b>ordan & <b>P</b>alestine", so I have retained the abbreviation as a convenient
        shorthand
        term.</p>
    <p>Having mentioned the origin of the term & the South Levantine Arabic dialect grouping, I must
        point out that these terms have little if any linguistic validity. Ethnologue — the ultimate
        arbiter in the matter, as far as the ISO is concerned — is not even an organization of
        linguists. No linguist that I'm aware of would argue that South Levantine Arabic is a
        "language"
        & I furthermore think that, even as a general grouping of dialects, the classification is
        more
        inaccurate, misleading and generalizing than not. I'm simply compelled to use the term,
        particularly on Wiktionary.</p>
    <p>That brings us to the crucial question: What is AJP? Is it a dialect of Arabic? Does it have
        a
        meaningfully distinct identity — or, rather: What is it distinct from? The Arabic used in
        Jerusalem is different from that of Damascus. And it's different from that of Nazareth or
        even
        Amman as well, even if the differences between them get increasingly smaller. Where does one
        dialect end & another begin?</p>
    <h2>Mainstream Ideologies</h2>
    <p>Situating AJP is not an easy task, because it must be situated in relation to something else:
        It
        requires some theory of what Arabic itself is. Simplifying for the sake of brevity, among
        laypeople these theories generally fall into two camps, which flow from the same
        assumption:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)</b> is canonical Arabic, whereas</li>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>the dialects are simply non-standard forms of MSA, not languages.</li>
            <li>the dialects are too different from MSA; they are independent languages.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
    <p>I believe language ideology surrounding Arabic is so polarized & politically charged
        precisely on
        account of how easy it is to subscribe to either of these theories. Indeed, they rely on the
        same assumptions: One is free to decide what degree of difference is sufficient to designate
        a
        dialect an independent language, something to which linguistics itself has never claimed to
        have
        the answer.</p>
    <p>Notably, these mainstream accounts are strengthened by a <b>synchronic</b> analysis (i.e. at
        a
        single point in time) of the uses of MSA & Spoken Arabic. Linguistically, the Arab World is
        characterized by widespread <b>diglossia</b>: While everyone acquires a dialect of Spoken
        Arabic
        through socialization, anyone with a basic education — or, in the past century, any exposure
        to
        media — has some command of MSA as well. Given that most native speakers are proficient in
        both,
        they may overlook the fact that MSA would probably not be mutually intelligible with Spoken
        Arabic for someone who was not exposed to the former from childhood, like heritage speakers
        &
        the illiterate.</p>
    <h2>Linguistic Theories</h2>
    <h3>Diachronic Analysis</h3>
    <p>In contrast, historical linguists focusing on Arabic have offered a diachronic analysis of
        the
        dialects (i.e. of their evolution over time) that entirely debunks the notion that they are
        directly descended from MSA. In fact, MSA is not equivalent to <b>Quranic Arabic</b> in the
        first place; MSA itself is a descendant of it. Meanwhile, today's dialects of <b>Spoken
            Arabic</b> are descended from several dialects that were siblings of the dialect that
        was
        canonized in the Quran. Although their ancestors were displaced officially by Quranic
        Arabic,
        they continued to enjoy popular use & undergo evolution to this day.</p>
    <p>What this would imply is that MSA & Spoken Arabic are neither in a parent-child nor
        sibling-sibling relationship; they are cousins, meaning that the Arabic language family is
        far
        more complex than what mainstream theories imply. It means that the Arabic dialect of
        Jerusalem
        is not just a dialect of Arabic more generally, but a dialect of Spoken Arabic specifically
        —
        not a dialect of MSA, its distant cousin.</p>
    <img src="{{ asset('img/fig1.svg') }}" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto">
    <p>As we can see in the foregoing diagram, AJP would be a subcategory of Levantine Arabic, which
        in
        turn is a form of Spoken Arabic. Note that MSA remained a single unit through strict
        standardization, while Spoken Arabic was diversified into a group of dialects with no
        standard
        form. My conclusion from this analysis is thus quite distinct from that of the mainstream
        theories:</p>
    <ol start="2">
        <li><b>MSA</b> & <b>Spoken Arabic</b> are two distinct varieties of one language
            (Arabic).
            While the former is a single unit, the latter is a highly diversified grouping of
            dialect continua (e.g. <b>Levantine</b>) with their own sub-groupings (e.g. <b>Palestinian</b>)
            & their various sociolects (e.g. <b>Urban</b>) & locolects (e.g. <b>Jerusalemite</b>).
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Why distinct "varieties" & not distinct languages, or distinct dialects for that matter? (One
        should be cautious of using such terms altogether, as they have no definitive — well,
        definition.)</p>
    <p>Semantically speaking, the term "dialect" usually refers to some form of vernacular speech;
        it
        does not usually account for fully-featured language varieties only used in particular
        settings
        (e.g. liturgical languages). It therefore would be a somewhat misleading designation for
        MSA.
        Moreover, MSA & Spoken Arabic are, in my view, too different to think of as merely dialects.
        Not
        only is mutual intelligibility low — it would likely fall outside the Levant, as Levantine
        dialects tend to have the largest percentage of shared vocabulary with MSA. Here are just
        some
        of the key differences between MSA & Spoken Arabic:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Morphology</b> — Spoken Arabic lost case marking, all passivity, dual agreement &
            often gender agreement in the plural. Essentially the same morphology & word
            derivation
            from roots.
        </li>
        <li><b>Lexicon</b> — Both varieties have borrowed terms via language contact, but often
            not
            the same terms or to the same extent.
        </li>
        <li><b>Semantics</b> — MSA & Spoken Arabic may prefer different lexemes even when
            alternatives are technically present in the lexicon. High-frequency lexemes are
            often
            present in both varieties with entirely different meanings.
        </li>
        <li><b>Syntax</b> — Spoken Arabic has significantly less syntactic flexibility, but the
            formulations it does allow are generally valid in MSA.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, MSA & Spoken Arabic are not distinct languages either — at least not yet. What this
        chart demonstrates is that, although MSA is significantly more complex than Spoken Arabic in
        essentially every regard, their underlying grammar is not significantly different. (Indeed,
        this
        is why I personally emphasize the benefit of learning Spoken Arabic first & then building
        toward
        MSA; it is — for what it's worth — the natural path of acquisition for native speakers
        too.)</p>
    <p>In fact, several of the key differences between the two are deliberately enforced: It is
        generally accepted that languages have tended to lose some of their complexity over time;
        the
        trademark example of case marking happens to be one of the key features of MSA morphosyntax,
        while the dialects lost all case marking through organic change. Had the dialects that were
        canonized into Quranic Arabic evolved similarly (in fact, there is convincing evidence that
        some
        such dialects exist), they would likely not be as different to other Spoken Arabic dialects
        MSA
        is.</p>
    <h3>Synchronic Analysis</h3>
    <p>Now that we have offered a <b>diachronic</b> analysis of the origins of MSA & Spoken Arabic
        to
        argue that they are two different varieties of the same language, we need to return to the
        <b>synchronic</b>
        analysis of <b>diglossia</b> among Arabic speakers to ask: How can we know where one variety
        ends & the other begins? Consider the following two phrases:</p>
    <div class="array">
        {{--        <x-card num="1" ar="أريد أنّ أذهب إلى السوق" en="ʔurīdu ʔann ʔaḏhaba ʔila as-sūq"--}}
        {{--                gl="I want to go to the market"/>--}}
    </div>
    <div class="array">
        {{--        <x-card num="2" ar="بدّي أروح على السوق" en="biddi ʔarūḥ ʕala is-sūʔ"--}}
        {{--                gl="I want to go to the market"/>--}}
    </div>
    <p>Lexically, the items <b>أراد</b> & <b>ذهب</b> clearly mark the first phrase as MSA,
        represented
        by <b>بدّ</b> & <b>راح</b> — respectively — in the Spoken Arabic phrase, while the dative
        preposition with a directional meaning is replaced by a slightly different preposition in
        Spoken
        Arabic as well. Syntactically, MSA uses <b>إنّ</b> before the <b>Subjunctive</b> & uses
        word-final case markers to indicate grammatical function in the sentence. Phonologically,
        <b>الـ</b> is realized as <b>[ɪl]</b> in Spoken Arabic, while <b>/q/</b> is replaced by
        <b>/ʔ/</b>.</p>
    <p>Apparently, there are several indicators of the variety in use within any given utterance.
        But at
        the word level, things are not so clear. It is actually rare to mix the two varieties in any
        meaningful way beyond word choice. But should the use of terms "from MSA" be thought of as
        an
        instance of mixing varieties in the first place — or of mixing registers (i.e. formal vs.
        casual)? In the diglossic setting, the lexicons of MSA & Spoken Arabic coexist in the mind
        of
        the speaker & are accessible at any time. How, then, can we draw the line — if there is one
        —
        between the MSA lexicon & the Spoken Arabic lexicon?</p>
    <p>Since MSA is highly normative, it is easier to say that using certain terms (e.g. <b>بدّ</b>)
        as
        they are used in Spoken Arabic is proscribed, if not invalid. However, whether an MSA term
        may
        be used in the dialect is more reliant on an individual judgment of whether or not its use
        seems
        "natural" in the dialect — a more subjective judgment that is influenced by the individual's
        own
        extent of diglossia. Due to sheer exposure, someone who produces MSA on a daily basis may
        find
        the use of a certain term in the dialect more "natural" than the next person. Using
        <b>رَجُل</b>
        instead of <b>زَلَمة</b> is arguably quite unnatural, yet using <b>طِفل</b> instead of
        <b>وَلَد</b> is certainly plausible, even if the former is certainly more marked.</p>
    <p>How can we know, then, what terms to include in a dictionary of Palestinian Arabic? One place
        to
        start is by noticing that the Palestinian Arabic lexicon — like that of many other languages
        —
        has at least two etymological categories pertaining to diachronic origin: <b>inherited
            terms</b>
        & <b>learned borrowings</b>. In brief, <b>inherited terms</b> are those that have undergone
        all
        the evolutionary changes that distinguish the contemporary language from its ancestor at the
        time the term was coined or introduced. On the other hand, <b>learned borrowings</b> are
        introduced — often from an ancestor or prestige form of the language — with the morphology &
        phonological features of the donor language intact.</p>

        </div>
    </div>
    <p>By taking inventory of the morphological & phonological features of the Spoken Arabic dialect
        in
        study, we can distinguish between terms that were inherited from earlier forms of the
        dialect
        versus borrowings from MSA. Urban Palestinian dialects, for instance, have no native
        <b>/ð/</b>
        — it merged with <b>/d/</b> over time. Consequently, inherited terms with <b>/ð/</b> at the
        time
        of their inception now feature <b>/d/</b>, while learned borrowings maintain <b>/ð/</b>
        (realized as <b>[ð]</b> or, more commonly, <b>[z]</b>).</p>
    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: flex-start">
        <div class="inline-chart inherited">
            <div class="chart-title">INHERITED TERM</div>
            <div>أخد</div>
        </div>
        <div class="inline-chart inherited">
            <div>MSA ʔaḵaḏ (to take) <-> AJP ʔaḵad / byāḵud (to take)</div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: flex-start">
        <div class="inline-chart learned">
            <div class="chart-title">LEARNED BORROWING</div>
            <div>آخذ</div>
        </div>
        <div class="inline-chart learned">
            <div>MSA ʔāḵaḏ (to admonish) <-> AJP ʔāḵaz / byāʔḵiz (to admonish)</div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>However, terms that only feature phonemes that did not undergo change over time cannot be
        assessed in this way. Generally, "semantically precise" terms (e.g. <b>اغتال</b> "to
        assassinate") are more likely to be learned borrowings, yet since all the phonemes in
        <b>اغتال</b> are natively attested in the dialects, we cannot by means of phonology alone
        make
        such a judgment for this term.</p>
    <p>Although phonology is the main way we can distinguish between <b>inherited terms</b> & <b>learned
            borrowings</b> in Spoken Arabic (the native phonology of Spoken Arabic is discussed in
        further detail in the section on Phonology), morphology plays a role as well. <b>Form 4
            (أفعل)</b>, for instance, is rare in the dialect, if not natively non-existent (with the
        possibly singular exception of <b>أعطى</b>). Aside from "semantically precise" terms (e.g.
        <b>أعلن</b>
        "to announce"), all terms that are attested in this form in MSA & have currency in the
        dialects
        have a native <b>Form 1 (فعل)</b> or <b>Form 2 (فعّل)</b> version. We can therefore argue
        that
        all <b>Form 4</b> terms attested in the dialect are <b>learned borrowings</b>.</p>
    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: flex-start">
        <div class="inline-chart">
            <div class="chart-title">COMPARE: MSA</div>

            <div>أشتى</div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>However, this approach has significant limitations as well. Given the very sparse attestation
        evidence of Spoken Arabic over time, rarely can we know when a term started being used in
        Spoken
        Arabic: Has <b>أشتى</b> been in the dialects since the medieval period, or has it enjoyed
        currency in the dialects more recently? (Let's not forget that before the global boom in
        literacy, MSA most likely had a far weaker influence on Spoken Arabic.) This is important
        because it means we don't have a way to properly determine whether certain terms are
        actually
        learned borrowings present in the Spoken Arabic lexicon versus lexical items from MSA that
        are
        seamlessly used on account of most native speakers having access to both lexicons. Just
        because
        someone uses the term <b>رَجُل</b> does not necessarily mean it's in the native Spoken
        Arabic
        lexicon.</p>
    <p>One indicator of lexical attestation could be the whether the term may be subject to Spoken
        Arabic inflections. In the case of <b>أشتى</b>, the acceptability of <b>بشتي</b> suggests
        that
        the term is present in the Spoken Arabic lexicon. Conversely, consider that more educated
        speakers may summon MSA passive forms to convey a precise meaning due to the absence of
        native
        passive forms in Spoken Arabic (e.g. <b>الكلمة تُعتبر مش منيحة</b>); these passive
        inflections
        are not generalizable, but rather are attested purely on a case-by-case basis & usually
        without
        the imperfect marker <b>بـ</b>. However, this criterion is not very reliable: the imperfect
        marker <b>بـ</b> may be optionally attached regardless of the inflection's lack of general
        attestation in the dialect (<b>الكلمة بتُعتبر مش منيحة</b>).</p>
    <p>In summary, <b>داق</b> (from <b>ذاق</b>) is definitely an inherited term, while <b>ذوق</b> is
        definitely a learned borrowing. But <b>أشتى</b> may be either a learned borrowing or — if
        inflectional flexibility is considered irrelevant — it may not be in the Spoken Arabic
        lexicon
        at all. Finally, <b>اغتال</b> could be an inherited term, a learned borrowing, or not in the
        lexicon. While it is probably fair to say that <b>أشتى</b> & <b>اغتال</b> are learned
        borrowings
        rather than unattested, we have no formal basis on which to make such a conclusion; there
        are
        many terms that will be far harder to make a call on.</p>
    <h3>Concluding Thoughts</h3>
    <p>In summary, I neither claim that MSA & Spoken Arabic are distinct languages nor that "the
        Arabic
        of Jordan & Palestine" itself has any sort of distinct identity. I use AJP as a shorthand.
        In
        reality, the notion is not well defined internally or externally. Questions remain: If the
        dialects of Palestine & Jordan have something in common that adjacent dialects lack, what
        exactly is that? Is there a more accurate way to categorize dialects according to shared
        features than via geography & country borders?</p>
    <p>But defining the linguistic identities & phylogenetics of the dialects of the Levant is far
        beyond the scope of this project. Just as British schools teach British English — not
        American
        English — I can only teach what I know. If I say I'm teaching AJP, then, what exactly am I
        referring to? Often, the name of a country is used in the mainstream to refer to the dialect
        of
        its most influential region or city (i.e. the capital). As for this site, it's not really a
        full
        outline of "Palestinian Arabic" (does such a thing exist?), but a description of the Spoken
        Arabic dialect used in Jerusalem specifically. I have tried to note some of the salient
        features
        of surrounding dialects to furnish a fuller picture of the linguistic landscape of
        Palestine,
        but the starting point is the Urban dialects of Central Palestine.</p>
    <p>I may not have all the answers you wanted, but I like to believe that the result is highly
        accurate.</p>
